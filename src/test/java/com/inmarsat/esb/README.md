## Notes

These test suites are provided as examples for how to mock and simulate integration points like external services, databases, queues, etc. Please use them as starting points for some of your tests and delete the ones that are not needed. Also, remember to delete the dependencies from pom.xml that are not needed so we can keep your service as lean as possible.

Automated tests need to be isolated and standalone so all interactions with external systems needs to be mocked or simulated. These examples use the tools we recommend for that purpose. If you plan to use different tools please seek guidance from the IICE team first to ensure that your plans align with Inmarsat's policies related to acceptable tools and components.
